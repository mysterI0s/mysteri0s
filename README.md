### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jaafer!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as the lead Flutter developer at a tech company, building cross-platform mobile apps.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my Python skills, focusing on web scraping and data collection for AI training.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI-driven mobile projects or anything involving smart, data-powered apps.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m exploring how to use scraped real-world data effectively in machine learning pipelines.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Flutter, mobile app architecture, clean code practices, or backend integration (Laravel, ASP.NET).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to hit me up via any of my socials or drop me a message here on GitHub!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've led frontend teams in 3 companies and still love building UIs as much as solving backend logic.
